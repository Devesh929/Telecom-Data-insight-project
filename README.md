## AWS Machine Learning for Telecommunications
Machine learning (ML) helps Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers use historical data to predict future outcomes, which can lead to better business decisions. 

Machine learning techniques are core to the Communications Service Providers (CSPs) industry. CSPs can use ML algorithms to construct and refine mathematical models from their business data, and then use these models to help identify fraudulent use of network services, automate network functions (zero touch), and reduce customer churn. 
AWS offers several machine learning services and tools tailored for a variety of use cases and levels of expertise, however it can be a challenge to understand the mechanics of model training and tuning, identify relevant data features, and design a workflow that can perform complex extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) activities, and also scale to accommodate large datasets. 
To help customers get started with a machine learning workflow for CSPs use cases, AWS offers the Machine Learning for telecom starter kit solution. This solution uses AWS CloudFormation to deploy a scalable, customizable machine learning architecture that leverages Amazon SageMaker, a fully managed machine learning service, and Jupyter Notebook, an open source web application for creating and sharing live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. 
The solution package provides a framework for an end-to-end machine learning process including ad-hoc data exploration, data processing and feature engineering, and model training and evaluation. It includes a sample telecom IP Data Record (IPDR) dataset to demonstrate how to use machine learning algorithms to test and train models for predictive analysis in telecom. Customers can use the included models as a starting point to develop their own custom machine learning models, and customize the included notebooks for their own use case.
